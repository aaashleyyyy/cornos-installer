## FAQ
#### Why does Mac OS warn me when I try to run it? 
Because we don't want to pay like $99 a year to apple for an apple developer's license. Please read the section on how to install on a mac to bypass this warning. 
#### The installer didn't do anything. 
It is likely you forgot to install the [fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).
